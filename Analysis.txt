Run Time Analyis

Task0
Complexitiy of O(1) as only list indexing is used. No loops and they runtime is not effected by the input size.

Task1
2 single level for loops and thus a complexity of O(n).

Task2
If statements embedded in a for loop. No embedded for loop thus O(n)

Task3
The sort() function is used which has a worst-case performance of O(nlogn)

Task4
Same reasoning as Task3; O(nlogn)
